## Project Description
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data to understand various factors affecting patients. The dataset contains patient information, including demographics, health conditions, and hospitalization status. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Objectives
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and incorrect data classifications.
Standardize column names for consistency.
Replace numerical health condition indicators (e.g., 1/2) with meaningful labels (e.g., "Yes"/"No").

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identify trends in patient demographics, including age, gender, and pre-existing conditions.
Understand the impact of pre-existing conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) on COVID-19 severity.
Analyze hospitalization trends and mortality rates.

## Data Visualization:

Use bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps to illustrate key findings.
Identify correlations between patient attributes and COVID-19 outcomes.

## Key Insights
Health Conditions & Severity:

Patients with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension show higher hospitalization rates.
Immunosuppressed patients tend to have severe outcomes.

Demographics & Outcomes:
Elderly patients (60+ years) are more likely to require hospitalization.
Gender distribution may show that male patients are more affected.

Hospitalization Trends:

A significant number of patients return home after treatment, while others require hospitalization.
Certain health conditions may correlate with increased hospital admissions.

## Recommendations
Public Health Awareness:

Strengthen awareness campaigns for high-risk groups (elderly and those with chronic diseases).
Encourage early testing and monitoring for patients with pre-existing conditions.
Hospital Resource Planning:

Prioritize ICU and hospital resources for patients with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.
Develop predictive models to forecast hospitalization needs based on patient conditions.
Preventive Measures:

Implement targeted vaccination and booster shot campaigns for high-risk demographics.
Encourage healthier lifestyles to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 cases.
