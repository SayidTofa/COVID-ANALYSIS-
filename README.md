## ABOUNT COVID-19-ANALYSIS
The main goal of this project is to build an analysis that, given a Covid-19 patient's current symptom, status, and medical history, will predict whether the patient is in high risk or not.

The provided code is a Jupyter Notebook that performs an analysis of COVID-19 data. The dataset, named Covid Data.csv, contains information about COVID-19 patients, including various attributes such as age, sex, medical conditions, and outcomes. The notebook is structured to load the data, perform some initial data exploration, clean and preprocess the data, and then conduct some basic analysis.
